# Machine learning for non small cell lung cancer nodal staging from PETCT molecular imaging
This project investigates a range of machine learning classification algorithms in predicting the benign vs malignant status of lung nodes associated with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as diagnosed from endobronchial guided ultrasound biopsy procedure (EBUS). The algorithms use radiomic features extracted from F18 FDG PETCT images which are obtained prior to EBUS.
